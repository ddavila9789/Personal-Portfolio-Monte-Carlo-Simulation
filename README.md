1. A Monte Carlo Simulation is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot be easily predicted due
   to the intervention of random variables. This technique is used to to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and
   to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models. 
   
   Monte Carlo Simulations are used to aid in the solving of multiple problems in virtually every analytical field, such as finance, engineering, 
   supply chain, and science. It is also referred to as a multiple probability simulation.
   
   Monte Carlo simulations are named after the popular gambling destination in Monaco, since chance and random outcomes are central to the 
   modeling technique, much as they are to games like roulette, dice, and slot machines.

   Monte Carlo Simulation, also known as the Monte Carlo Method or a multiple probability simulation, is a mathematical technique, which is used to
   estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event. The Monte Carlo Method was invented by John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam during World War II
   to improve decision making under uncertain conditions. It was named after a well-known casino town, called Monaco, since the element of chance is
   core to the modeling approach, similar to a game of roulette.
   
   The basis of a Monte Carlo simulation is that the probability of varying outcomes cannot be determined because of random variable interference. 
   Therefore, a Monte Carlo simulation focuses on constantly repeating random samples to achieve certain results.

   A Monte Carlo simulation takes the variable that has uncertainty and assigns it a random value. The model is then run and a result is provided. 
   This process is repeated again and again while assigning the variable in question with many different values. Once the simulation is complete, the 
   results are averaged together to provide an estimate.
   
   
2. The importance of utilizing a Monte Carlo Simulation on financial assets/portfolios is mainly due to its use of random variables to account for
   the significant uncertainties that appear in the process of creating a forecast or estimation.
   
   Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the impact of the risks within finance such as stock prices, sales forecasting, project management, 
   and pricing.
   
   
3. Through creating and running this Monte Carlo Simulation, I have a better understanding of my own portfolio and see the vast amount of outcomes
   that may occur in the given time span. Similar to the Bell Curve, the outcomes tend to deviate from the middle in certain forecasts but the 
   simulations almost always stay close to the intial investment. It seems as though not much will change during the alotted time as only a few of
   the simulations has shown evident gain or loss within the portfolio. 
   
   The ability to visualize the forecast of my portfolio, with uncertainties accounted for, is very revealing as well as intriguing. It will be 
   interesting to see which way my portfolio decides to go throughout these 100 days. Looking back to this chart will be great use as a reference
   to assess my portfolio.
   
   Ultimately, I believe this project was a success as it truly uncovers the potential of my portfolio at the time of writing. It is definitely 
   a simulation I will run again in the future when in need of a forecast or insight on my portfolio.
